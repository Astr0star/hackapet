# Space Pet 14

This is a game inspired by the games [Space Station 13/14](https://spacestation14.com/)

Your are a [moth person](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Playable_Species#Moths) (yes, you read that right) on a [space station](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Maps), you're working as an engineer and your job is to keep the station running, earn points (WIP) and don't screw anything up!

# Your Job

You have to do a couple things to keep the station afloat

- Keep the [tiders](https://www.reddit.com/r/ss14/comments/1d5d6pr/how_to_tide_101_starter_tide/) out! Doors might start [opening](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Hacking), you have to fix them when they do!
- Keep the [AME](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#The_Antimatter_Engine) running! make sure it's fueled up and no pesky [antags](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Antagonist#Syndicate_agent) mess with it!
- Keep [solars](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#Solar_Power) in check!
- Keep the [singulo](https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Power#Gravitational_Singularity_Engine) from loosing!
- Get screamed at by the crew! It's part of the job!

## WIP

The game **_isn't finished yet_** and probably won't be completed by the deadline but I'll keep updating it even after the deadline!
